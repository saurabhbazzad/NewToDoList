This is an improved version of the previos to do list
User has options to mark tasks as complete/incomplete.
User can delete individual tasks.
User can sort tasks based on weather they are done/not done.
User can clear tasks from lists which are done.
This to-do list has better UI/UX.
The list is retained even after window is refreshed/closed as data is stored in local storage.
Buttons for up/down for prioritizing tasks are present in UI, but their functionality is not written in JS.
This has to done in next version.
